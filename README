lish -- a limited shell
=======================
lish(1) is a very simple, restricted command-line interpreter or shell.
Its goal is to allow the execution of only a fixed set of commands read
from a simple configuration file.  lish(1) is suitable to be used as the
ssh(8) ForceCommand or via the 'command=' restriction in an ssh public
key.

Please see https://www.netmeister.org/blog/lish.html and the lish(1)
manual page on
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jschauma/lish/master/doc/lish.1.txt for
details.


Supported Platforms
===================
lish(1) is written in Go and should work on most Unix-like platforms.

lish(1) was tested on the following systems:

- CentOS release 5.10
- CentOS release 6.5
- Mac OS X 10.10


How to install lish(1)
======================
'make install'

The simplistic provided Makefile will build lish(1) and then copy it
together with its manual page under /usr/local or wherever PREFIX points
to.


How to use lish(1)
==================
You need to create a configuration file in /etc/lishrc containing the
commands that all users of lish(1) are allowed to execute.

If you wish to allow additional commands for the user 'jdoe', you can also
create an additional file /etc/lish/jdoe.

Please see the manual page of lish(1) for the configuration file syntax.

If you plan on using lish(1) only in combination with sshd(8)'s
ForceCommand (or 'command=' restrictions in an ssh pubkey), then you're
all set.  If you plan on assigning lish(1) as the login shell for a user,
you probably need to also update /etc/shells to include /usr/bin/lish (or
wherever you may have installed lish(1)).
